abstract: Studies of evolutionary processes and dispersion of Dengue genomes in Brazil
  are relevant for guiding the knowledge of the endemo-epidemic and social impact
  on emerging arboviruses, i.e., Zika, Chikungunya, Dengue, and reorienting the practices
  of epidemiological surveillance of these diseases. Analyzes of trees and phylogenetic
  networks are capable of exhibiting evolutionary and reticulated events observed
  in viruses due to the high diversity mediated by a high mutation rate and frequent
  homologous recombination, leading to antiretroviral resistance and immune evasion.
  We present a parallel and distributed scientiﬁc workﬂow for phylogenetic networks
  analyzing Dengue genomes, which is efﬁcient to be scaled in the Flaviviridae family’s
  genomes.
