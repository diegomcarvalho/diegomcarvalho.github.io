 abstract = {Studies of evolutionary processes and dispersion of Dengue genomes in Brazil are relevant for guiding the knowledge of the endemo-epidemic and social impact on emerging arboviruses, i.e., Zika, Chikungunya, Dengue, and reorienting the practices of epidemiological surveillance of these diseases. Analyzes of trees and phylogenetic networks are capable of exhibiting evolutionary and reticulated events observed in viruses due to the high diversity mediated by a high mutation rate and frequent homologous recombination, leading to antiretroviral resistance and immune evasion. We present a parallel and distributed scientiﬁc workﬂow for phylogenetic networks analyzing Dengue genomes, which is efﬁcient to be scaled in the Flaviviridae family’s genomes.},
