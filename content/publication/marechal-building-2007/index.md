abstract: Several international projects and collaborations have emerged in the last
  years due to the increasing demand for grid distributed resources around the world.
  One important aspect of these initiatives deals with the “gridiﬁcation” of computing
  intensive scientiﬁc applications otherwise difﬁcult to run efﬁciently. The EELA
  Project (E-Infrastructure shared between Europe and Latin America) is a collaboration
  between Latin American and European institutions that has developed a potent e-Infrastructure
  for e-Science applications. This paper describes the consolidated EELA e-Infrastructure
  and the progress achieved so far.
