 abstract = {Several international projects and collaborations have emerged in the last years due to the increasing demand for grid distributed resources around the world. One important aspect of these initiatives deals with the “gridiﬁcation” of computing intensive scientiﬁc applications otherwise difﬁcult to run efﬁciently. The EELA Project (E-Infrastructure shared between Europe and Latin America) is a collaboration between Latin American and European institutions that has developed a potent e-Infrastructure for e-Science applications. This paper describes the consolidated EELA e-Infrastructure and the progress achieved so far.},
