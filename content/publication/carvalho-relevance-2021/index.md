abstract: Flight delays are a signiﬁcant problem for society as they evenly impair
  airlines, transport companies, air traﬃc controllers, facility managers, and passengers.
  Studying prior ﬂight data is an essential activity for every player involved in
  the air transportation system. Besides, developing accurate prediction models for
  ﬂight delays is a crucial component of the decision-making process. Prescribing
  actions to solve on-going delays is an even challenging task due to the air transportation
  system complexity. In this regard, this paper presents a thorough literature review
  of data science techniques used for investigating ﬂight delays. This work proposes
  a taxonomy and compiles the initiatives used to address the ﬂight delay studies.
  It also oﬀers a systematic literature review that describes the trends of the ﬁeld
  and methods to analyse the applicability of newly proposed methods.
