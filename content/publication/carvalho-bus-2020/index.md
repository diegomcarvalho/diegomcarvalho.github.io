abstract: In recent years, studies on public transport networks have intensified in
  the Social Networks’ field, especially in bus networks. This has occurred because
  of the relevance of urban mobility for the proper functioning of a city. The Rio
  de Janeiro city, Brazil, has undergone recent changes in the city of Rio de Janeiro,
  Brazil, has undergone recent changes in its municipal bus system, modifying several
  lines and bus stops. This paper proposes to analyze the structure of the bus transportation
  network of this city, comparing its topology in 2014 and 2016 – before and after
  the change. For this, the properties of the bus system were investigated based on
  the topological models B-space, P-space and C-space. Some important parameters were
  calculated, such as giant component, distance, diameter, degree, closeness and betweenness.
  The results showed that there was a reduction of 22.75% of the lines and 5.19% of
  the bus stops from 2014 to 2016. It was also verified that a maximum of four lines
  are required to move between any two bus stops within the city in both years. However,
  with three lines is possible to reach more than 99% of the bus stops. Besides, this
  study also suggests exploring the C-space network according to a minimum number
  of common bus stops that the lines had. Based on the component giant analysis of
  these networks with many common points, it is possible to detect possible expressway
  corridors.
