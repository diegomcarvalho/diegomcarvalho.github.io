 abstract = {A Social Network Analysis applied to logistics and supply networks has contributed and assisted planning and logistics managers to identify methods for evaluating partnership networks. The relationship between supplier and buyer extends to other disciplines, and the social relationship is one of them. Several authors have written about the subject, but the lack of quantitative data analysis shows that there is still a need for future studies. In this article, the use and application of social network metrics in supply chain were analyzed. The degree, betweenness and closeness centrality of a node in a supply chain network helps the perception of information that is not captured bytraditional methods or theories in logistics. So a supply chain network from a company of the Brazilian electricity sector was evaluated in an attempt to identify a method of selecting and understanding the behavior of suppliers and buyers in a real case study.},
