abstract: A Social Network Analysis applied to logistics and supply networks has contributed
  and assisted planning and logistics managers to identify methods for evaluating
  partnership networks. The relationship between supplier and buyer extends to other
  disciplines, and the social relationship is one of them. Several authors have written
  about the subject, but the lack of quantitative data analysis shows that there is
  still a need for future studies. In this article, the use and application of social
  network metrics in supply chain were analyzed. The degree, betweenness and closeness
  centrality of a node in a supply chain network helps the perception of information
  that is not captured bytraditional methods or theories in logistics. So a supply
  chain network from a company of the Brazilian electricity sector was evaluated in
  an attempt to identify a method of selecting and understanding the behavior of suppliers
  and buyers in a real case study.
