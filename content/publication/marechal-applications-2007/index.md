abstract: The EELA Project (E-Infrastructure shared between Europe and Latin America)
  is a collaboration between Latin American and European institutions that has developed
  a potent e-Infrastructure for e-Science applications. Nowadays, several groups have
  ported their applications to the EELA Grid framework and are obtaining their Ô¨Årst
  results thanks to the e-Infrastructure that has been created. This paper describes
  the applications already ported and the progress achieved so far.
