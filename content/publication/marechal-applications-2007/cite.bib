 abstract = {The EELA Project (E-Infrastructure shared between Europe and Latin America) is a collaboration between Latin American and European institutions that has developed a potent e-Infrastructure for e-Science applications. Nowadays, several groups have ported their applications to the EELA Grid framework and are obtaining their Ô¨Årst results thanks to the e-Infrastructure that has been created. This paper describes the applications already ported and the progress achieved so far.},
