 abstract = {This paper proposes approaches to GPS trajectory classiﬁcation problem in the context of the Rio de Janeiro’s public transit system (with hundreds or more classes). We adopt a weightless neural network architecture combined with both spatial partition and multiclass decision graphs, inspired by a neuro-symbolic sense of adding knowledge from the domain as opposed to the use of a raw machine learning. Experimental results show performance boosts when using some of the proposed strategies.},
