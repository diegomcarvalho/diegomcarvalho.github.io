abstract: This paper proposes approaches to GPS trajectory classiﬁcation problem in
  the context of the Rio de Janeiro’s public transit system (with hundreds or more
  classes). We adopt a weightless neural network architecture combined with both spatial
  partition and multiclass decision graphs, inspired by a neuro-symbolic sense of
  adding knowledge from the domain as opposed to the use of a raw machine learning.
  Experimental results show performance boosts when using some of the proposed strategies.
