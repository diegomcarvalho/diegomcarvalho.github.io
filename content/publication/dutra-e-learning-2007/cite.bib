 abstract = {The EELA Project was created with the aim of supporting the increasing demand for Grid Infrastructures to foster the collaboration among groups of Latin America and Europe. As a starting point, several applications have been selected in four scientific fields. One of the most important areas among them is e-Learning due to its high impact and significance in the Latin America society. Newly applications are being developed by several groups from Latin America participating in the project. This article will shortly describe the EELA project itself and the current status and aims of the six e-Learning applications to be deployed.},
