The new algorithm keeps the simplicity and daintiness of the Scheduling by Edge Reversal ({SER}) distributed algorithm, originally conceived to support the heavy load condition. Both {SER} and {SERH} distributed algorithms share the same communication and computational complexities and can also be seen as graph dynamics where the messages exchanged between a processing node and its neighbors are represented as “edge reversal” operations upon directed acyclic graphs representing the target distributed system. Nevertheless, {SERH} allows such distributed system to deal with the situation of having processing nodes leaving the heavy load behavior and going into a “hibernating” state, and vice versa. It is shown here that {SERH} has a communication cost approximately 25\% lower than the traditional Chandy and Misra’s distributed solution, when operating near to heavy load conditions. In order to illustrate the usefulness of {SERH} in this interesting situation, an application in the distributed control of traﬃc lights of a road junction is also presented here.},

        abstract = {In recent years, studies on public transport networks have intensified in the Social Networks’ field, especially in bus networks. This has occurred because of the relevance of urban mobility for the proper functioning of a city. The Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, has undergone recent changes in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has undergone recent changes in its municipal bus system, modifying several lines and bus stops. This paper proposes to analyze the structure of the bus transportation network of this city, comparing its topology in 2014 and 2016 – before and after the change. For this, the properties of the bus system were investigated based on the topological models B-space, P-space and C-space. Some important parameters were calculated, such as giant component, distance, diameter, degree, closeness and betweenness. The results showed that there was a reduction of 22.75\% of the lines and 5.19\% of the bus stops from 2014 to 2016. It was also verified that a maximum of four lines are required to move between any two bus stops within the city in both years. However, with three lines is possible to reach more than 99\% of the bus stops. Besides, this study also suggests exploring the C-space network according to a minimum number of common bus stops that the lines had. Based on the component giant analysis of these networks with many common points, it is possible to detect possible expressway corridors.},

This paper tackles this problem by introducing a novel approach to discovering such factors through pattern mining using association rules. The novelty of the method arises from introducing social network analysis inside the pattern mining process. The social networks metrics for each student and the degree of propagation of grade point average are computed and integrated with students’ records for pattern mining serving as a proxy for the existing bond among students, which is a relevant factor for attrition and dropout analysis. This paper examines the Bachelor Program in Production Engineering at the Federal Center for Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro from 2011 to 2017. Our experiments indicate congruence with the literature: (i) lower school performance leading to delay; (ii) higher performance leading to graduation in optimal time. Besides, our new method sheds light on students with little participation in the social network who are more likely to delay or drop out. Our findings may aid managers in discovering students with patterns that can indicate imminent lateness or dropout.},
